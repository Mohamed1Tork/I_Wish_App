# I-Wish-App
An application developed using java



Our app  is designed to simplify the process of creating wish lists and facilitating group contributions.
users can create wish lists for any occasion and share them with their friends, who can then contribute towards fulfilling the wishes.

The app allows users to add items to their wish lists, set a budget for each item, and keep track of their progress towards fulfilling each wish. Friends can then contribute any amount towards any wish, making it easy for everyone to participate.

i-wish makes the process of gift-giving fun and collaborative, reducing the stress of finding the perfect gift and making it easier for everyone to contribute towards a meaningful gift


Architecture and GUI:

The app has been designed with a three-tier architecture, with a presentation layer, a business logic layer, and a data storage layer. Also we have used models like : DAL(data access layer) -DTO(Data transfer object).
The GUI has been developed using JavaFX using (Scene Builder Tool), and we have focused on creating a user-friendly interface that is intuitive to use.



Technology used:

- i-wish app has been developed using Java 8, with the Netbeans IDE as our development environment.

- scene builder to build fxml files 

- JDBC Library

- CSS

- Oracle  DB (Triggers played a big role!)
